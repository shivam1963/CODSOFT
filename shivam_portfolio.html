            <h3>ONLINE BUS RESERVATION</h3>
            <img src="https://images.projectsgeek.com/2016/02/Bus-Booking-System.jpg" alt="Project Image 1">
            <p>Project Overview:

                The Online Bus Reservation System is a Java console application designed to manage bus reservations
                efficiently. The project provides a streamlined, user-friendly interface for booking, canceling, and
                viewing bus reservations. This system is ideal for small to medium-sized bus operators looking to
                digitize their reservation process.

                Key Features:

                User Authentication:

                User registration and login functionalities ensure secure access to the system.
                Bus Schedule Management:

                Admins can add, update, and delete bus schedules, including details such as bus number, departure time,
                arrival time, and available seats.
                Reservation System:

                Users can search for available buses based on the destination and date, book seats, and receive a unique
                booking ID.
                Booking Management:

                Users can view their booking history, and admins can view all bookings.
                Cancellation:

                Users can cancel their reservations using their booking ID, and the system updates the seat availability
                accordingly.
                Technical Details:

                Programming Language: Java
                Development Environment: Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
                Data Storage: ArrayLists or file handling for storing user data, bus schedules, and reservations
                User Interface: Console-based input/output for interaction
                Implementation Highlights:

                Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes and objects to represent buses, users, and reservations,
                promoting modularity and code reusability.
                Exception Handling: Ensures robust and error-free operation by handling input mismatches, invalid
                operations, and system errors gracefully.
                Data Persistence: Uses file handling to save and retrieve data, ensuring that information is retained
                between sessions.
                Conclusion:

                The Online Bus Reservation System in Java Console is a comprehensive project that showcases proficiency
                in Java programming and console-based application development. It is an excellent starting point for
                understanding the intricacies of booking systems and the application of object-oriented principles in
                real-world scenarios.</p>
